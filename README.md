# Pomodoro Time Management and Focus Tracker

### Overview

The **Pomodoro Time Management and Focus Tracker** is a web application designed to help students manage their study time effectively using the Pomodoro Technique. This technique consists of focused study intervals of 25 minutes, followed by short 5-minute breaks. The application features a timer, detailed analytics of study sessions, and a gamified system to reward consistent study habits.

This project integrates several technologies to offer a seamless user experience, providing a timer, tracking features, and motivational rewards to encourage productive study habits.

This Pomodoro Time Management and Focus Tracker project aims to provide students with an effective tool to improve their productivity by leveraging time management techniques and gamification. It combines real-time tracking, visual analytics, and motivation through rewards to ensure sustained focus and academic success.

Hereâ€™s a simplified setup instruction for your Next.js and Express project:

---

## **1. Clone and Set Up Instruction**

1. **Clone the Pomodoro project**:

   ```bash
   git clonehttps://github.com/monishatBaishnab/pomodoro-client
   cd pomodoro-client
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables (optional)**:

   - Create a `.env.local` file in the root and add your environment variables if needed.

4. **Run the Next.js project**:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   Visit `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.

---

## **2. Clone and Set Up Express Server**

1. **Clone the Express project**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/monishatBaishnab/pomodoro-server
   cd pomodoro-server
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Set up environment variables (optional)**:
   - Create a `.env` file in the root and add any required environment variables.

Here are the environment variable names for your server setup:

```bash
DATABASE_URL=<Your database URL>
ENABLE_PRISMA_CACHING=<true/false>  # Enable Prisma caching (true/false)
PORT=<Port number>  # Port on which the server will run, default is 5000
BCRYPT_SALT=<Salt rounds for bcrypt encryption>  # e.g., 10

APP_PASS=<Your app's password for internal use>

JWT_SECRET=<Secret key for JWT token generation>

CLOUDINARY_CLOUD_NAME=<Your Cloudinary cloud name>
CLOUDINARY_API_KEY=<Your Cloudinary API key>
CLOUDINARY_API_SECRET=<Your Cloudinary API secret>

BASE_URL=<Base URL of your app, e.g., 'http://localhost:5000'>
STORE_ID=<Store ID for Cloudinary or related services>
SIGNATURE_KEY=<Secret key used for verifying signatures>
```

4. **Run the Express server**:

   ```bash
   node server.js
   ```

   The Express server will be available at `http://localhost:5000`.

---

## **3. Connect API Between Next.js and Express**

- Ensure your Next.js frontend makes requests to the correct Express API endpoint (`http://localhost:5000`).
- Make sure CORS is configured in your Express project to allow connections from the Next.js app.

---

## **4. Project Running**

- **Next.js**: `http://localhost:3000`
- **Express API**: `http://localhost:5000`
